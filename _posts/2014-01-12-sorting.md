#Quick sort
##improvement for Quick Sort
1. Cutoff to insertion sort.  
1.1  Quicksort is slower than insertion sort for tiny subarrays.  1.2 Being recursive, quicksortâ€™s sort() is certain to call itself for tiny subarrays.
2. Median-of-three partitioning.
3. Entropy-optimal sorting.
	nvm, too complicated for me to understand
	
##Quicksort with 3-way partitioning

```
 public class Quick3way  {     private static void sort(Comparable[] a, int lo, int hi)     {  // See page 289 for public sort() that calls this method.        if (hi <= lo) return;        int lt = lo, i = lo+1, gt = hi;        Comparable v = a[lo];        while (i <= gt)        {           int cmp = a[i].compareTo(v);           if      (cmp < 0) exch(a, lt++, i++);           else if (cmp > 0) exch(a, i, gt--);           else              i++;        }  // Now a[lo..lt-1] < v = a[lt..gt] < a[gt+1..hi].        sort(a, lo, lt - 1);        sort(a, gt + 1, hi);} }
```

this algorithm is important because:
**it reduces the time of the sort from linearithmic to linear for arrays with large numbers of duplicate keys.**
